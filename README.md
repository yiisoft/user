The package handles user-related functionality:

- Login and logout.
- Getting currently logged in identity.
- Changing current identity.
- Access checking for current user.
- Auto login or "remember me" based on request cookie.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher.

## Installation

The package could be installed with composer:

```
composer require yiisoft/user --prefer-dist
```

## General usage

## Working with identity

...

## Auto login through cookie

In order to log user in automatically based on request cookie presence, use `CookieLoginMiddleware`.

By default, you should set cookie for auto login manually in your application after logging user in:

```php
public function login(
    \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request,
    \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseFactoryInterface $responseFactory,
    \Yiisoft\User\Login\Cookie\CookieLogin $cookieLogin
): \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface {
    $body = $request->getParsedBody();
    
    // Get user identity in based on body contents,
    // log user in.
    
    $response = $responseFactory->createResponse();
    if ($body['rememberMe'] ?? false) {
        $response = $cookieLogin->addCookie($identity, $response);
    }
    return $response;
}
```

In the above `rememberMe` in the body may come from a "remember me" checkbox in the form. End user decides if he wants
to be logged in automatically. If you do not need the user to be able to choose and want to always use "remember me",
you can enable it via `params.php`:

```php
return [
    'yiisoft/user' => [
        'cookieLogin' => [
            'addCookie' => true,
        ],
    ],
];
```
